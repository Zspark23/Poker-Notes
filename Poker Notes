# Formulas
#### Pot Odds
 - (Pot + Bet) : Bet
   - ($100 + $500) : $500 = 6:5 = ~45%

#### Fold Frequency
 - Bet / (Pot + Bet)
 - Ex 1. $100 / ($100 + $100) = 1/2 = 50%
 - Ex 2. $300 / ($100 + $300) = 3/4 = 75%
   - Only call with the top 25% of your range

#### Equity (roughly)
 - Flop: # of outs * 4
 - Turn: # of outs * 2

# Position

- Out of position = Defense
 - Play a tighter range, keep your "guard" up.
- In position = Offense
 - Looking to maximize profit
- When first sitting down at a tournament table, have a baseline for how you want to play, and adjust based on any information you see. Are they aggressive? Passive? Can you get away with limping? Continue to adjust based on the table.

#### Early position
- Tighter range
- Early position range:

#### Middle position
- If its good enough to call, it's good enough to raise.
- Might get some players behind you out, then you can play in position.

#### Late position
- Open with a much wider range of hands.
- Where we want to make most of our money

#### Big Blind
- Has a mandatory bet to put in, incentivizing them to play, but still needs to be careful since they're in the worst position at the table.
- "Defend" with a wider range of hands since you already have a portion of the bet in. Good pot odds regardless.

#### Small Blind
- Also has a mandatory bet to put in, incentivizing them to play, but still needs to be careful since they're in the worst position at the table.
- Still play with a tight range.

# Hand Ranges and Board Texture
- Want to focus on putting players on a range of hands. Play "My range vs. my opponents range"
- Build a mental 'database' of the range of hands your opponent plays
- As betting increases, their range becomes more polarized.
- Keep your range balanced, don't always make the same move every time.
- The person with the *range advantage* should be 'driving the action'.
 - Bet more often than you check, but not always to keep range balanced.
- Factor player tendencies into range advantage.
  - Is the player a tighter player or a looser player in the position they're in?
- Adjust your range based on the players around you, not based on stakes.

#### How to adjust your ranges based on perception
- Make constant adjustments to your range from certain positions based on the other players perception of you.
 - If you're getting re-raised a lot from a specific person
   - Take the bottom end of your range and chop it off
   - Play a tighter range
 - If people are folding often to your raises
   - Take the bottom end of your range and expand it
   - Play a looser range, incorporate some of the more 'fringe' hands

# C-betting
- Continuation bet, or, if you were the pre-flop aggressor, 'continuing the story' that you have a strong hand and betting on the flop.
- Don't always c-bet, and don't never c-bet.
- C-bet less into multiple people, especially when you miss the flop. Much easier to get one person to fold than four or five.

###### Ex. 1
  - Hero raises UTG with AKs, two MP players call, button calls, and both blinds call. Flop comes T52 rainbow.
    - C-bet less in this position because there are so many people behind, the chances of getting them all to fold is unlikely, as well as the chance at least one of them has a ten is pretty high.

###### Ex. 2
  - Hero raises UTG with AKs, only the button calls, flop is J97 two hearts.
    - C-bet less in this position since the button smashes that flop more often than you do.

# Recommended Raise Sizes
|Stack Depth      | When Folded to | When Facing a Limper | When Facing a Raise                          | When Facing a 3-bet |
|   :---:         |     :---:      |        :---:         |         :---:                                |        :---:        |
|60bbs or More    |2.75bbs         |4.5bbs                |3x In position (IP), 4x Out of position (OOP) |2.75x IP, 3.25x OOP  |
|35bbs to 60bbs   |2.5bbs          |4.25bbs               |2.7x IP, 3.2x OOP                             |2.5x IP, 3x OOP      |
|22bbs to 35bbs   |2.25bbs         |4bbs                  |2.7x IP, 3.2x OOP                             |All-in               |
|12bbs to 22bbs   |2bbs            |3.5bbs                |All-in                                        |All-in               |
|Fewer than 12bbs |All-in          |All-in                |All-in                                        |All-in               |


- Pot sized raise: 3x last bet + any additional money in the pot.
  - How much is a pot sized raise when someone raises to 4bbs and someone else calls?
    - 3 x 4 + 4 + .5 + 1 + 1 = 18.5bbs

- If a raise would put in more than 30% of your stack, go all-in instead.
- Add one "unit" for each additional caller.
