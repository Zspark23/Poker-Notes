# Formulas
#### Pot Odds
 - (Pot + Bet) : Bet
   - ($100 + $500) : $500 = 6:5 = ~45%

#### Fold Frequency
 - Bet / (Pot + Bet)
 - Ex 1. $100 / ($100 + $100) = 1/2 = 50%
 - Ex 2. $300 / ($100 + $300) = 3/4 = 75%
   - Only call with the top 25% of your range, in theory.

#### Equity (roughly)
 - Flop: # of outs * 4
 - Turn: # of outs * 2

# Position

- Out of position = Defense
 - Play a tighter range, keep your "guard" up.
- In position = Offense
 - Looking to maximize profit
- When first sitting down at a tournament table, have a baseline for how you want to play, and adjust based on any information you see. Are they aggressive? Passive? Can you get away with limping? Continue to adjust based on the table.

#### Early position
- Tighter range
- Early position range:

#### Middle position
- If its good enough to call, it's good enough to raise.
- Might get some players behind you out, then you can play in position.

#### Late position
- Open with a much wider range of hands.
- Where we want to make most of our money

#### Big Blind
- Has a mandatory bet to put in, incentivizing them to play, but still needs to be careful since they're in the worst position at the table.
- "Defend" with a wider range of hands since you already have a portion of the bet in. Good pot odds regardless.
  - Even though we are defending with a wider range, we should play cautiously after the flop still, since we are out of position.

#### Small Blind
- Also has a mandatory bet to put in, incentivizing them to play, but still needs to be careful since they're in the worst position at the table and they only have to put in half the bet the big blind does.
- Play with a tighter range then the big blind.

# Hand Ranges and Board Texture
- Want to focus on putting players on a range of hands. Play "My range vs. my opponents range"
- Build a mental 'database' of the range of hands your opponent plays
- As the number of bets increases (3-bet, 4-bet, etc.), their range becomes more polarized.
- Keep your range balanced, don't always make the same move every time.
- The person with the ***range advantage*** should be 'driving the action'.
 - Bet more often than you check, but not always to keep range balanced.
- Factor player tendencies into range advantage.
  - Is the player a tighter player or a looser player in the position they're in?
- Adjust your range based on the players around you, not based on stakes.

#### How to adjust your ranges based on perception
- Make constant adjustments to your range from certain positions based on the other players perception of you.
 - If you're getting re-raised a lot from a specific person
   - Take the bottom end of your range and chop it off
   - Play a tighter range
 - If people are folding often to your raises
   - Take the bottom end of your range and expand it
   - Play a looser range, incorporate some of the more 'fringe' hands

# C-betting
- Continuation bet, or, if you were the pre-flop aggressor, 'continuing the story' that you have a strong hand and betting on the flop.
- Don't always c-bet, and don't never c-bet.
- C-bet less into multiple people, especially when you miss the flop. Much easier to get one person to fold than four or five.
- C-bet more often on flops where you have ***range advantage***
- C-betting gives you more than one way to win the pot, fold equity, and actually hitting.  
- __Don't C-bet on autopilot__
- Potentially adjust c-betting frequency on body language and tells.
- Think a few moves ahead.
  - If you raise preflop:
    - What happens if he 3-bets?
    - What are you gonna do on the flop if he calls?
  - If you c-bet on the flop:
    - What do you do if he c-bets or check raises?
    - What do you do on the turn if he calls?
- If you're thinking about c-betting and can't come up with a couple good reasons, chances are you probably shouldn't.

###### Ex. 1
  - Hero raises UTG with AKs, two MP players call, button calls, and both blinds call. Flop comes T52 rainbow.
    - C-bet less in this position because there are so many people behind, the chances of getting them all to fold is unlikely, as well as the chance at least one of them has a ten is pretty high.

###### Ex. 2
  - Hero raises UTG with AKs, only the button calls, flop is J97 two hearts.
    - C-bet less in this position since the button smashes that flop more often than you do.
