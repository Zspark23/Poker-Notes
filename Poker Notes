# Formulas
#### Pot Odds
 - (Pot + Bet) : Bet
   - ($100 + $500) : $500 = 6:5 = ~45%

#### Fold Frequency
 - Bet / (Pot + Bet)
 - Ex 1. $100 / ($100 + $100) = 1/2 = 50%
 - Ex 2. $300 / ($100 + $300) = 3/4 = 75%
   - Only call with the top 25% of your range

#### Equity (roughly)
 - Flop: # of outs * 4
 - Turn: # of outs * 2

#### Implied Odds
 - (Amount remaining in Stacks + Pot) / Call Amount

#### Minimum Defense Frequency
 - 1 - opponents bet / (opponents bet + pot)

#### Stack-to-Pot Ratio
  - effective stack / money in pot

# Position

- Out of position = Defense
 - Play a tighter range, keep your "guard" up.
- In position = Offense
 - Looking to maximize profit
- When first sitting down at a tournament table, have a baseline for how you want to play, and adjust based on any information you see. Are they aggressive? Passive? Can you get away with limping? Continue to adjust based on the table.

#### Early position
- Tighter range
- Early position range:

#### Middle position
- If its good enough to call, it's good enough to raise.
- Might get some players behind you out, then you can play in position.

#### Late position
- Open with a much wider range of hands.
- Where we want to make most of our money

#### Big Blind
- Has a mandatory bet to put in, incentivizing them to play, but still needs to be careful since they're in the worst position at the table.
- "Defend" with a wider range of hands since you already have a portion of the bet in. Good pot odds regardless.

#### Small Blind
- Also has a mandatory bet to put in, incentivizing them to play, but still needs to be careful since they're in the worst position at the table.
- Still play with a tight range.

# Hand Ranges and Board Texture
- Want to focus on putting players on a range of hands. Play "My range vs. my opponents range"
- Build a mental 'database' of the range of hands your opponent plays
- As betting increases, their range becomes more polarized.
- Keep your range balanced, don't always make the same move every time.
- The person with the *range advantage* should be 'driving the action'.
 - Bet more often than you check, but not always to keep range balanced.
- Factor player tendencies into range advantage.
  - Is the player a tighter player or a looser player in the position they're in?
- Adjust your range based on the players around you, not based on stakes.

#### How to adjust your ranges based on perception
- Make constant adjustments to your range from certain positions based on the other players perception of you.
 - If you're getting re-raised a lot from a specific person
   - Take the bottom end of your range and chop it off
   - Play a tighter range
 - If people are folding often to your raises
   - Take the bottom end of your range and expand it
   - Play a looser range, incorporate some of the more 'fringe' hands

---
# C-betting
- Continuation bet, or, if you were the pre-flop aggressor, 'continuing the story' that you have a strong hand and betting on the flop.
- Don't always c-bet, and don't never c-bet.
- C-bet less into multiple people, especially when you miss the flop. Much easier to get one person to fold than four or five.

###### Ex. 1
  - Hero raises UTG with AKs, two MP players call, button calls, and both blinds call. Flop comes T52 rainbow.
    - C-bet less in this position because there are so many people behind, the chances of getting them all to fold is unlikely, as well as the chance at least one of them has a ten is pretty high.

###### Ex. 2
  - Hero raises UTG with AKs, only the button calls, flop is J97 two hearts.
    - C-bet less in this position since the button smashes that flop more often than you do.

# Intro & Fundamentals
### Recommended Raise Sizes
|Stack Depth      | When Folded to | When Facing a Limper | When Facing a Raise                          | When Facing a 3-bet |
|   :---:         |     :---:      |        :---:         |         :---:                                |        :---:        |
|60bbs or More    |2.75bbs         |4.5bbs                |3x In position (IP), 4x Out of position (OOP) |2.75x IP, 3.25x OOP  |
|35bbs to 60bbs   |2.5bbs          |4.25bbs               |2.7x IP, 3.2x OOP                             |2.5x IP, 3x OOP      |
|22bbs to 35bbs   |2.25bbs         |4bbs                  |2.7x IP, 3.2x OOP                             |All-in               |
|12bbs to 22bbs   |2bbs            |3.5bbs                |All-in                                        |All-in               |
|Fewer than 12bbs |All-in          |All-in                |All-in                                        |All-in               |


  - Pot sized raise: 3x last bet + any additional money in the pot
    - How much is a pot sized raise when someone raises to 4bbs and someone else calls?
      - 3 x 4 + 4 + .5 + 1 + 1 = 18.5bbs

- If a raise would put in more than 30% of your stack, go all-in instead.
- Add one "unit" for each additional caller.
- 3-bet to a smaller size when in position and larger when out of position.

# Preflop
## More than 60bbs
###### When you're folded to
- Don't open limp.
- When your opponents call or 3-bet often, raise tighter.
- When your opponents play too tight or rarely 3-bet, raise wider.
- Don't play shit hands.
- Generally raise to 3.5bbs in the SB if you're going to.

##### When your raise gets 3-bet
- The button should 3-bet to a smaller size than the BB.
  - As your opponent uses a bigger re-raise size, you should fold more often.
- 4-bet more when out of position, call more when in position
  - When you're in position, you want to keep the pot small.
  - When you're out of position, you want to inflate the pot to take away your opponents positional advantage
- You want to have a very polarized 4-betting range.
  - Use small Ax hands and Kx hands as 4-bet bluffs because you have blockers, your opponents will fold more often.
- Against people who play straightforward, fold a decent portion of your range.
- If the person is a maniac, defend with a decent portion of your range.
- Hands that tend to be dominated have reverse implied odds
  - As stacks get shorter, these hands become more playable.
  - These hands should be folded to a 3-bet more frequently, or used as a 4-bet bluff.
    - JQs, QTs, KJs, etc.
- Ex.1
  - You raise from LJ to 2.75bbs with AJo and the button 3-bets to 9bbs out of his 75bbs effective stack.
    - Against a tight player, always fold.
    - Against a maniac, always call or 4-bet.
    - Call with small and medium pocket pairs
    - Call with suited connectors against a maniac but fold against a tight player.

###### Minimum Defense Frequency
- Mathematical % that you must defend to keep your opponents from blindly profiting from pure aggression.
  - AKA: how to prevent from getting "run over" by bluffs
- MDF = 1 - opponents bet / (opponents bet + pot)
  - Make sure to account for blinds and antes
- Strive to over-defend when possible.
- If your opponent is tight, defend tighter.
- If your opponent is loose, defend looser.

###### Facing Limpers
- Facing one limper:
  - Two types of limpers:
    - Tricky, who like to limp with some premium hands, to trap
      - Most will limp/3-bet with only the best hands
      - Most are only capable of being tricky from early position
      - Limp behind with hands that flop well
      - Raise or fold with hands that don't flop well
      - Raising with the intention of folding to a 3-bet is fine if their range contains marginal hands
    - Straightforward, limps hands thought to be not good enough to raise
      - Raise with normal preflop raising range, maybe wider in some cases
      - Usually are limping with junk because they would have raised with good hands.
      - Raise a strong linear range of strong pairs, middle pairs, and big cards that don't mind being heads up
      - When you get limp/3-bet get out of the way.
      - Fine to limp behind with hands that flop well
- Facing multiple limpers:
  - Is the first limper tricky or straightforward?
  - Play a bit tighter than you normally would, unless all the limpers are weak
  - Raising to large amounts may be justified
  - Bluffing is still an option if you think they will fold
- When your limp gets raised:
  - Hands with reverse implied odds should fold almost always
  - If your opponent raises small, call with hands that flop well
  - If your opponent raises large, fold hands that flop poorly

###### Facing a Preflop Raise (When someone raises, and it folds to you)
- What is your opponents range?
- How likely are you to get 3-bet?
- How many players are likely to see the flop?
- How will your opponent to your aggression?
- Facing an early position raise:
  - Assume they have a decently strong range
  - Bluff a little less then charts recommend.
  - If you 3-bet and you get 4-bet, assume they have an extremely strong hand
  - If they limp often, assume their raises are strong.
- Facing a middle position raise
  - Still playing a polarized range
- Facing a late position raise
  - People sometimes tend to raise/defend too many hands from late position
- Playing from the blinds
  - The small blind:
    - You want to play heads up whenever possible
    - You want to 3-bet more when:
      - When the BB plays well
      - When the initial raiser plays timid
      - Against wide ranges
  - The big blind:
    - Aim to see a lot of flops
    - Defend wider as raises get smaller
    - Defender tighter against really large raises

###### Facing a preflop raise and a call
- Strategy will change based on opponents tendencies
  - Tight, Aggressive (TAG)
  - Tight, Passive (Nit)
  - Loose, Aggressive (LAG)
  - Loose, Passive (Calling Station)
- Against tight ranges:
  - RFI TAG:
    - Play fundamentally sound poker
    - Just follow the 75bb charts
  - RFI Nit
    - Fold unsuited big cards that are often dominated
    - Call more implied odds hands
    - 3-bet bluff much less often
  - RFI LAG:
    - Fold less often, widen range
    - Call more unsuited big cards that are ahead
    - 3-bet bluff more, polarized range
  - RFI Calling Station:
    - Fold less often, widen range
    - 3-bet unsuited big cards that are ahead
    - 3-bet for value more often, linear range
- Usually use a pot sized bet for all raises.
- From the big blind:
  - Getting a good "price" and "closing action" are not great reasons to defend your big blind multi-way
    - You will realize your equity poorly
    - Postflop playability is important
    - Don't play junky offsuit cards
    - Avoid playing hands that make mostly marginal hands
- How to continue from the big blind:
  - Continue as if you were on the button
    - Call with good suited cards
    - 3-bet bluff big unsuited cards
    - 3-bet for value with your best hands

###### When you call and get 3-bet
- What are the ranges?
- How many people are likely to see the flop?
- Are you closing the action
  - Will you get back 4-bet?
  - You can play a little looser, if you're closing the action. Can't get 4-bet
- What are your pot odds?

###### Facing a raise and a 3-bet
- You should have ***no calling range*** <75bbs
- You are going to get 4-bet often enough to kill your implied odds.
- Play exceptionally tight
  - You should not have a 4-bet bluffing range
  - 3-bet from EP: Usually only QQ+
  - 3-bet from LP: Usually only JJ+

###### Facing a preflop 4-bet
- Defending against a 4-bet is too often a huge leak
- Fold the vast majority of hands
- Usually only getting it in with JJ+ and AKs
- Against more aggressive opponents, defend wider
- If your range is polarized, just continue with the top of your range
  - Big pairs, big suited cards are good candidates for 4-bet bluff
- If your range is linear, fold the worse offsuit hands


## 35bbs - 60bbs
###### When folded to
- Generally when your SPR decreases, your standards for going all-in decrease
  - You're not risking as much, so you get to be wrong more often
- Follow GTO charts, unless opponents make clear mistakes
- Most deep stack concepts will still apply with 35-60bbs
- Positional advantage matters a little less as you get shallower stacked
- Raise more from out of position, raise less from in position
